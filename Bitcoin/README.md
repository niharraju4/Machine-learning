# Bitcoin Price Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the historical price data of Bitcoin, exploring trends, volatility, and potential trading strategies using Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing, statistical calculations, and visualizations to provide insights into Bitcoin's price movements.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

You can clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-price-analysis.git
cd bitcoin-price-analysis
jupyter notebook Bitcoin_final.ipynb
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code cells. The notebook is structured to guide you through the analysis process, from data loading to visualization. You can modify the code to analyze different time periods or apply additional statistical methods.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and create new features.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate moving averages and percentage changes.
- **Visualizations**: Line plots, histograms, and other charts to visualize trends and patterns in Bitcoin's price.
- **Interpretation**: Insights and observations based on the analysis.

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle/Other Source]. It includes daily closing prices of Bitcoin, along with other financial metrics.

## Visualizations

The notebook includes several visualizations such as:

- **Closing Price Over Time**: A line plot showing the trend in Bitcoin's price.
- **Moving Averages**: Short-term and long-term moving averages to identify trends.
- **Percentage Change**: Visualizing the daily percentage change in Bitcoin's price.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights the volatile nature of Bitcoin and suggests potential strategies for trading based on historical data. However, it is important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

## Future Work

- **Integration with Real-Time Data**: Update the analysis to include real-time Bitcoin data.
- **Advanced Modeling**: Apply machine learning models to predict future prices.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare Bitcoin with other cryptocurrencies or financial assets.

Project Plan: Travel Planning Assistant with Real-Time Price Checking
Project Overview
The Travel Planning Assistant is a chatbot application that helps users plan their trips by suggesting destinations, creating itineraries, and checking real-time prices for flights, hotels, and car rentals. The application will leverage AWS cloud services, external APIs, and a serverless architecture to deliver a scalable and efficient solution.

Key Features
Destination Recommendations: Suggest destinations based on user preferences.
Itinerary Creation: Automatically generate itineraries with activities and local attractions.
Real-Time Price Checking: Fetch and update real-time prices for flights, hotels, and car rentals.
Budget Tracking: Track and optimize the travel budget.
Travel Tips and Alerts: Provide travel tips, alerts, and reminders.
Google Calendar Integration: Sync itineraries with Google Calendar.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (for a responsive UI)
Backend: AWS Lambda with API Gateway (for serverless processing)
Database: DynamoDB (for storing user preferences and travel plans)
File Storage: AWS S3 (for storing itineraries and user data)
Chatbot Framework: AWS Lex (for natural language processing)
APIs: External APIs for real-time price checking (e.g., Skyscanner, Booking.com)
Data Analysis: AWS Comprehend (for sentiment analysis and personalized recommendations)

UI Design: Design a user-friendly interface for inputting travel preferences and viewing itineraries.
API Integration: Connect the frontend to the API Gateway endpoints.
Deployment: Deploy the frontend on S3 with static website hosting.
3. Backend Development
Lambda Functions:
User Preferences: Handle input and storage of user preferences.
Itinerary Generation: Create itineraries based on user inputs and available data.
Real-Time Price Fetching: Fetch data from external APIs.
API Gateway:
Set up endpoints for interacting with the Lambda functions.
Implement rate limiting and security features.
DynamoDB Integration:
Store and retrieve user data, preferences, and itineraries.
Google Calendar Integration:
Sync user itineraries with Google Calendar using Google Calendar API.
4. Chatbot Integration
AWS Lex:
Build the conversational interface to interact with users.
Integrate Lex with Lambda for processing user inputs and generating responses.
Comprehend:
Use AWS Comprehend to analyze user input and provide personalized recommendations or sentiment analysis.
5. Real-Time Price Integration
API Research: Identify and set up accounts with travel-related APIs (Skyscanner, Booking.com).
Lambda Functions:
Develop functions to fetch and process data from external APIs.
Implement caching and rate limiting to optimize API usage.
Budget Tracking:
Implement logic to track and update the travel budget based on real-time prices.
6. Testing and Optimization
Unit Testing: Test individual components (Lambda functions, API integrations).
End-to-End Testing: Simulate user interactions to ensure the entire system works as intended.
Performance Optimization:
Optimize Lambda functions for speed and efficiency.
Monitor usage with CloudWatch and adjust as necessary.
